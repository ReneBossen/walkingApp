# Code Review: Plan 20b - Users Feature Backend Routing

**Plan**: `docs/plans/20b_ArchitectureRefactor_Users.md`
**Iteration**: 1
**Date**: 2025-01-25

## Summary

The implementation successfully refactors the Users feature to route operations through the backend API. All planned endpoints (preferences GET/PUT, avatar POST) are implemented with proper validation, error handling, and test coverage. The mobile layer correctly uses `apiClient` for the specified operations. The code follows architectural patterns and coding standards.

## Checklist Results

### Architecture Compliance
- [x] Dependency direction preserved (Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Supabase)
- [x] No business logic in controllers (controllers are thin HTTP adapters)
- [x] Feature slices are independent and loosely coupled
- [x] Common folder contains only shared infrastructure
- [x] Screaming Architecture principles respected

### Code Quality
- [x] Follows coding standards
- [x] No code smells detected
- [x] Proper error handling with guard clauses
- [x] No magic strings (constants used: `MinDailyStepGoal`, `MaxDailyStepGoal`, etc.)
- [x] Guard clauses present (`ValidateUserId`, `ValidateAvatarFile`, etc.)

### Plan Adherence
- [x] All plan items implemented
- [x] No unplanned changes
- [x] No scope creep

### Testing
- [x] Tests cover new functionality
- [x] Tests are deterministic
- [x] All backend tests pass (171 tests passed)

## Issues

### BLOCKER

None identified.

### MAJOR

None identified.

### MINOR

#### Issue #1: Mobile usersApi.ts retains direct Supabase calls for some methods

**File**: `E:\Github Projects\Stepper\WalkingApp.Mobile\src\services\api\usersApi.ts`
**Lines**: 171-350
**Description**: The following methods still use direct Supabase calls:
- `getUserProfile()` (line 171)
- `getUserStats()` (line 202)
- `getWeeklyActivity()` (line 231)
- `getMutualGroups()` (line 303)

**Note**: These are documented in comments as intentional ("still uses Supabase directly as there's no dedicated backend endpoint"). This is acceptable because:
1. The plan specifically scopes only `getCurrentUser`, `updateProfile`, `uploadAvatar`, `getPreferences`, and `updatePreferences` for refactoring
2. The remaining methods are for features outside the current plan scope

**Suggestion**: Consider adding these to a future plan for consistency once backend endpoints are available.

#### Issue #2: UserPreferences mobile model mismatch with backend

**File**: `E:\Github Projects\Stepper\WalkingApp.Mobile\src\services\api\userPreferencesApi.ts`
**Lines**: 82-106
**Description**: The mobile `UserPreferences` interface has granular notification and privacy settings that the backend does not support. The mapping function (`mapPreferencesResponse`) derives these from the simplified backend model.

**Note**: This is acceptable and well-documented. The implementation:
1. Maps backend's simplified model to mobile's granular model
2. Preserves granular settings locally on updates
3. Documents the limitation in comments

**Suggestion**: Document this design decision in an ADR if not already captured.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### Backend
| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| GET /api/v1/users/me/preferences returns user preferences | PASS | `UsersController.cs` line 126-149 |
| PUT /api/v1/users/me/preferences updates and returns preferences | PASS | `UsersController.cs` line 156-188 |
| POST /api/v1/users/me/avatar accepts multipart form data | PASS | `UsersController.cs` line 195-234 with `[Consumes("multipart/form-data")]` |
| Avatar upload validates file type (images only) | PASS | `UserService.cs` lines 327-334 validates content type |
| Avatar upload validates file size (max 5MB) | PASS | `UserService.cs` lines 347-354, constant at line 16 |
| Avatar is stored in Supabase Storage | PASS | `UserService.cs` lines 356-377 uploads to "avatars" bucket |
| User profile is updated with new avatar URL | PASS | `UserService.cs` lines 229-230 |
| All endpoints have XML documentation | PASS | All public methods documented |

### Mobile
| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| usersApi.ts makes zero direct Supabase data calls for specified methods | PASS | `getCurrentUser`, `updateProfile`, `uploadAvatar` use apiClient |
| userPreferencesApi.ts makes zero direct Supabase data calls | PASS | Both methods use apiClient |
| Avatar upload works with FormData | PASS | `usersApi.ts` lines 149-163 |
| All existing functionality works as before | PASS | API mapping preserves mobile interface |
| Updated tests pass | PASS | Tests mock apiClient correctly |

## Code Quality Analysis

### DTOs (Backend)

**UserPreferencesResponse.cs** - Clean record with XML documentation.
**UpdateUserPreferencesRequest.cs** - All fields nullable for partial updates.
**AvatarUploadResponse.cs** - Simple record with URL.

### Service Layer (Backend)

**UserService.cs** highlights:
- Line 19-35: Well-defined constants for allowed types and extensions
- Line 37-41: Valid distance units defined as HashSet for O(1) lookup
- Line 196-218: Clean separation of concerns with helper methods
- Line 221-233: Avatar upload follows single responsibility pattern
- Line 308-354: Comprehensive file validation

### Controller Layer (Backend)

**UsersController.cs** highlights:
- Lines 122-234: Three new endpoints matching plan exactly
- Consistent error handling pattern across all endpoints
- Proper use of `[Consumes("multipart/form-data")]` for avatar upload

### Mobile Layer

**usersApi.ts** highlights:
- Lines 104-112: Clean mapping function for case conversion
- Lines 149-163: FormData construction for avatar upload

**userPreferencesApi.ts** highlights:
- Lines 82-106: Thoughtful mapping from simplified backend to granular mobile model
- Lines 138-196: Preserves granular settings locally after update

### Test Coverage

| Test File | Test Count | Coverage |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| UserServicePreferencesTests.cs | 17 tests | GET/PUT preferences, validation, edge cases |
| UserServiceAvatarTests.cs | 21 tests | File validation, size, type, extension, auth |
| UsersControllerPreferencesTests.cs | 10 tests | HTTP responses, auth, errors |
| UsersControllerAvatarTests.cs | 11 tests | HTTP responses, file handling |
| usersApi.test.ts | 18 tests | API calls, mapping, error handling |
| userPreferencesApi.test.ts | 15 tests | API calls, mapping, defaults |

## Code Smells Detected

None detected. The implementation is clean and follows established patterns.

## Security Considerations

- [x] Avatar file validation prevents arbitrary file uploads
- [x] Content type and extension validation provides defense in depth
- [x] File size limit prevents DoS via large uploads
- [x] Authentication required for all endpoints
- [x] User ID extracted from JWT claims, not request body

## Recommendation

**Status**: APPROVE

The implementation fully satisfies all acceptance criteria from Plan 20b. The code is well-structured, properly tested, and follows all architectural and coding standards. The minor issues noted are design decisions that are already documented and acceptable.

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] No action required - implementation is complete
- [ ] Consider future plan for remaining Supabase-direct calls in usersApi.ts (optional)
